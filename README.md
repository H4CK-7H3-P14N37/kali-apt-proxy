# Using a Proxy for Kali System Updates During Penetration Testing

## Why Use a Proxy for Kali Updates?
When performing penetration testing, using a proxy for Kali Linux system updates provides several key advantages, including security, anonymity, and efficiency. Hereâ€™s why setting up a proxy is beneficial:

### 1. **Preserving Anonymity**
- When updating Kali during a pentest, directly fetching updates from official mirrors can reveal your IP address.
- Using a proxy (such as a VPN, SOCKS proxy, or a transparent HTTP proxy) helps conceal your actual network identity.

### 2. **Avoiding Network Detection**
- Some corporate or client networks may monitor outbound traffic, and downloading Kali updates can trigger security alerts.
- A proxy can help obfuscate these requests and bypass restrictions on security-related tools.

### 3. **Traffic Control and Logging**
- Using a proxy allows for logging and monitoring of update requests.
- This can be useful for compliance and auditing purposes, ensuring that only intended updates are fetched.

### 4. **Speed and Caching**
- Proxies can cache frequently used packages, reducing redundant downloads and saving bandwidth.
- This is particularly useful when working in a team environment where multiple systems need the same updates.

### 5. **Bypassing Network Restrictions**
- Some networks block access to Kali repositories.
- A proxy (or tunneling updates through SSH or a VPN) can help circumvent such restrictions and ensure smooth updates.

## NOTE: this guide assumes you can connect back to the server over a secure channel like Tailscale or Wireguard.

## How to Configure a Proxy for Kali Updates on the Server Side
This assumes Nginx isn't used for anything else on this system
```
chmod +x install_kali_proxy.sh
sudo ./install_kali_proxy.sh
```


## How to Configure a Proxy for Kali Updates on the Client Side
To configure a proxy for APT package updates, edit the APT configuration file:

```
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf
```

Add the following lines, replacing `<PROXY_IP>` and `<PORT>` with your proxy details. This IP and Port should Privoxy:

```
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://<PROXY_IP>:<PORT>/";
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://<PROXY_IP>:<PORT>/";
Acquire::http::Proxy {
	<PROXY_IP> DIRECT;
}
```

Save and exit, then update your package list:

```
sudo apt update
```

Also, override the default sources list. This IP and Port should match Nginx:

```
echo 'deb http://<PROXY_IP>:<PORT>/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware' > /etc/apt/sources.list
```


Example /etc/apt/sources.list
```
deb http://127.0.0.1:9999/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
```

Example /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf
```
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8118/";
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8118/";
Acquire::http::Proxy {
    127.0.0.1 DIRECT;
}
```
